This repository contains your very own Personal notes based Q/Answer System built with Streamlit, LangChain, ChromaDB, HuggingFace embeddings, and Groqâ€™s LLM. The application enables users to upload notes as PDF documents, extract text, create a vector-based retrieval system, and perform question-answering using LLM-powered retrieval-augmented generation (RAG).

## Features
PDF Parsing: Extracts text from uploaded PDFs using PyPDF2.
Text Preprocessing: Utilizes RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter for chunking text to enhance retrieval efficiency.
Vector Database: Implements Chroma as a persistent vector storage solution.
Hugging Face Embeddings: Leverages sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2 to create dense vector representations of document chunks.
LLM Integration: Uses Groq-hosted Llama3-8b-8192 to generate answers based on retrieved document context.
Streamlit UI: Provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for seamless PDF Q&A interactions.
